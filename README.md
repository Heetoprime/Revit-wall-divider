# Revit-wall-divider
Divides walls into 5 equal vertical parts

Credits to Jeremy Tammik for the original code that I based my code off of, this is basically an updated version for Revit 2019.
Webpage where I got the original: https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/parts-assemblies-partutils-and-divideparts.html

I've included RevitAPI + RevitAPIUI files for those new to this, just in case. Also this addin will not work on any walls that were
created before this addin was loaded for some reason. Also included a bit of modelline code also by Jeremy, which I used to debug my
code.

First time making an addin! Was fun but frustrating at times.
