# Revit-wall-divider
Divides walls into equal vertical parts

Credits to Jeremy Tammik for the original code that I based my code off of, this is basically an updated version for Revit 2019.

First time making an addin! Was fun but frustrating at times. (Images not included, you can replace those with anything)
If someone wants to know where to put these files I can put that here in the readme too.
